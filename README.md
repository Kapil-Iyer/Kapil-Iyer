# Hi, I'm Kapil Iyer

Applied Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo specializing in **Scientific Machine Learning and Statistics**, with a minor in Computing.

I build machine learning systems for quantitative finance, with an emphasis on **rigorous evaluation, interpretability, and production constraints**. My work focuses not just on whether models perform well in isolation, but whether they are reliable, understandable, and genuinely useful in real-world settings.

## 🔬 Current Work

**Quantitative Research — Wat Street (University of Waterloo)**  
Modeling volatility contagion across S&P 500 assets using Temporal Graph Neural Networks, with performance benchmarked against econometric baselines such as GARCH and HAR-RV to evaluate statistical and predictive validity.

**AI Engineering — Dazia Consulting Inc.**  
Designing and implementing a full-stack AI tutoring system for financial certification education.

I built production-oriented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines processing 1,500+ pages of CSC and IFIC certification content, while also developing the backend services required to support real-world usage. This included building Express.js REST APIs for tutoring and content-generation workflows, configuring CORS policies, and implementing rate-limiting middleware to enforce freemium usage constraints.

The system was designed with deployment and cost-awareness in mind. I optimized retrieval and prompting strategies to reduce token usage by approximately 30% while maintaining response quality, containerized backend services with Docker, and deployed authenticated, usage-tracked endpoints to support scalable inference.

**Co-Founder — Wanderers**  
Building an offline-first social discovery platform designed as a **social catalyst rather than a destination**.

Unlike traditional social or dating applications that optimize for feeds, ranking algorithms, and prolonged engagement, Wanderers is intentionally designed to minimize time spent in-app and maximize the likelihood of real-world interaction. The platform emphasizes small, interest-driven gatherings and fast transitions from discovery to offline connection, with success measured by meaningful meetups rather than engagement metrics.

Working on Wanderers has pushed me to think beyond model performance and feature completeness and instead reason about **user incentives, trust, and behavioral outcomes**. It has shaped how I approach system design: prioritize validation over polish, reduce unnecessary complexity, and build technology that quietly enables better human outcomes rather than competing for attention.

## 🎯 Engineering Philosophy

Across both technical and product-driven projects, I focus on:

- Rigorous benchmarking against strong baselines, not just training accuracy  
- Evaluation under real-world constraints such as cost, latency, and usability  
- Behavioral validation over feature accumulation  
- Building systems that deliver measurable value beyond surface-level engagement  

My long-term goal is to build **mathematically rigorous, accessible systems** that bridge institutional-grade analytics and real-world users, particularly in finance.
